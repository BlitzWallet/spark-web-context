# Spark Web Context for React Native

This library provides a background thread solution for using Spark in React Native. Since Spark operations can be computationally intensive, they sometimes block the main JavaScript thread. By offloading these operations to a WebView, we move them off the main thread, creating a smoother and more responsive experience for users.

For security, all communication between React Native and the WebView is encrypted. When the WebView first loads, it performs a handshake with the React Native host application, exchanging public keys. From that point on, all messages are encrypted using the shared session key. The WebView runs in a fully containerized environment with no external network access except to Spark, and no data is persistently storedâ€”everything is temporary and isolated.

We send postMessage function calls with the appropriate arguments from the React Native layer and listen for success or error messages from the WebView context. This allows React Native apps to interact with Spark wallets, payments, and transactions seamlessly.

## Features

- Full Spark Wallet implementation
- Encrypted communication between React Native and WebView
- Fully testable in a browser without React Native

## Installation

```bash
npm install spark-web-context@https://github.com/blitzwallet/spark-web-context.git
# or
yarn add spark-web-context@https://github.com/blitzwallet/spark-web-context.git

```

## Example Usage

```
import { WebView, WebViewMessageEvent } from "react-native-webview";

const html = require("spark-web-context");

// Example handler for messages from the Spark WebView
const handleSparkMessage = (event: WebViewMessageEvent) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.nativeEvent.data);
  <!-- Must decrypt message -->
  if (data.err) {
    console.error("Spark error:", data.err);
  } else {
    console.log("Spark result:", data.result);
  }
};

export const SparkWebView = () => {
  return (
    <WebView
      source={html}
      originWhitelist={["*"]}
      onMessage={handleSparkMessage}
    />
  );
};
```

# How it Works

Expose Spark API
All Spark wallet functions are exposed on window.sparkAPI and can be called from React Native by posting messages to the WebView.

Secure Communication
Messages are encrypted/decrypted using ECDH key exchange. React Native initiates a handshake to establish a session key.

WebView Event Listener
The WebView listens for messages, decrypts them if necessary, executes the requested Spark action, and sends the result encrypted back to React Native.

Mocking for Browser Testing
The WebView can be mocked in a browser for local testing, allowing you to call Spark functions without a React Native environment.
